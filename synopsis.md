# Tempy - synopsis
_"Your environment probing friend ;-)"_

## Overview
What tempy is, is a robot for reconnaissance in hazadous areas. It can be manually controlled or work a given area autonumously with plotted boundaries using GPS tracking. 

## I/O
Tempy will also be reporting his findings to a Discord front-end to keep the monitoring team (if used in a real environment) apprised of its status.
The Discord front-end will also serve as an additional control panel for the bot.

## On-board systems
It can be configured for almost all situartions. It can be tracked or wheeled and fittet with a huge range of types of sensors. Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric pressure, sound pressure, Radioactive, Thermal, chemical, and also audio input/output.

## Possible applications in the real world
Tempy could be used in the military as a recon bot for scouting the enemy's camp. It could also be used by emergency services to enter a dangerous environment and determine whether it's safe for humans to enter. It could also assist the bomb squad when detecting bombs to prevent any blown human insides. 

### What are the questions that need to be answered?
- *Could this actually work in a production environment?*
- *What are the possible issues with this approach?*
- *Technology failure or human error - what's more preferable?*
- *Do you think that with the listed data inputs, we could actually effectively gauge safety of a given environment, enough to send actual people in? What if something fucks up? Do we blame the tech, the operation manager,  or the introverted, socially awkward programmer who wrote the bot?*
